# Snake

My 3rd self programming project using JAVA!

Im doing this to not get rusty on programming in the meantime

Any suggestions please do tell! im happy to improve this especially because its very bad (i know)

Anyways try to enjoy this!

## Installation

Download the game here(https://github.com/roy2872/Snake/releases/tag/Windows),
Unzip it,
and run the Snake.bat! just like that.



## Known bugs

if the game opens, and the snake doesnt show up, reopen the game, that happens sometimes and idk why
